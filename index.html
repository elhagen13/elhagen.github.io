                    <p>Hi! I'm Ella Hagen, a second year computer science major!</p>
                    <p>At the moment, I'm planning on minoring in Computing for the Interactive Arts. I absolutely love all things
                        art, so I'm hoping to combine both art and computer science as much as I can. I think that there's a lot of 
                        possibilities when it comes to the combination of the two, especially when it comes to web development. I 
                        hate the idea of missing out on something I could grow to be passionate about, so I love teaching myself and
                        developing new skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>There's a lot of amazing things about computer science, but in all honesty, it's a little intimidating how 
                        versatile it is. That's why I think it's important to try as many aspects of it to find your niche.
